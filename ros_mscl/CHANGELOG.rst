^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.1.4 (2021-07-30)
------------------
* Installs MSCL from CMake to hopefully allow this package to be built in the buildfarm
* Merge pull request `#70 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/70>`_ from ori-drs/master
  [ros_mscl] Turn filter_data_rate and imu_data_rate into an argument
* [ros_mscl] Turn filter_data_rate and imu_data_rate into an argument
* Eliminated build warnings
* Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow the rtk dongle to be enabled as it was using the wrong variable to enable it.
* See changelog
* Added aiding measurement summary for each GNSS (GQ7 only)
  Added MSCL version output when node starts
* Merge pull request `#50 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/50>`_ from civerachb-cpr/master
  Add an arg to enable setting NED/ENU frame parameter
* Add an arg to enable setting NED/ENU frame parameter
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Nathan Miller, Wolfgang Merkt, nathanmillerparker, robbiefish

1.1.3 (2021-04-21)
------------------
* Removed duplicate Filter LLH Pos entry in message format
  Preparing for release on Bloom
* Merge pull request `#49 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/49>`_ from civerachb-cpr/rosdep-fix
  Add tf2_geometry_msgs as a dependency
* Add tf2_geometry_msgs as a dependency
* Merge pull request `#48 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/48>`_ from civerachb-cpr/master
  Make frame IDs configurable
* Add args for all of the frame ids to allow them to be modified when launching.  Keep the old static values as the defaults.
* Added frame ids back in to not break existing configurations
* Added a flag to set ENU as the local reference frame
  Moved sensor2vehicle frame transformation setting code to occur if filter data is not enabled
  See changelog for more info
* Added user notifications in the case a command isn't supported by a device.
  Added support for the speedometer lever arm offset command
* Corrected description in launch file to point out the quaternion version of the sensor2vehicle frame transformation is not currently supported on the GQ7
* Added ROS_INFO/ROS_ERROR reporting for setting sensor2vehicle frame transformation... had a silent error for the quaternion version on the GQ7.
* Added the filter GPS timestamp packet to the configured messages.
* - Driver modified to support MSCL version 61.1.6
  - Fixed missing boolean set for RTK status message publishing
* Timestamp change:
  1. Launch file setting "use_device_timestamp" (bool) created to allow user to select between device generated timestamp and packet received time (generated using PC time upon packet reception.)
  - Some applications require the PC received time to sync with other packages
  - Some applications require the device generated timestamp for accurate time of when the data was generated
  Hopefully, this satisfies both needs.
* Merge pull request `#36 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/36>`_ from arpg/master
  Fixed issue including mscl_msgs

* Merge branch 'master' into msg
* Warning: Contains breaking change to /nav/odom message!
  Code cleanup, new features, bug fixes
  See changelog for complete list of changes

* Merge pull request `#30 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/30>`_ from CaptKrasno/gps_corr
  Added support for gps_correlation_timestamp packet
* changed default value for  m_publish_gps_corr to false
* Merge branch 'master' into gps_corr
* Merge pull request `#31 <https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/issues/31>`_ from CaptKrasno/gravity
  redefined g according to the spec
* redefined g according to the spec
* Added support for gps_correlation_timestamp packet
* Modified filter, GNSS, and RTK timestamp handling to disregard valid flags (to match IMU handling)
* Added IMU GPS timestamp as a default data setup quantity.
  Removed IMU timestamp validity check so time still streams prior to GPS lock.
* Fixed bug preventing device report service from working on a GQ7.
* Added support for raw binary file output and RTK status message (see changelog for details)
* Added PPS Source, GPIO Config, and external GPS time updating
* Added feature checking for filter reset and imu category

* 1) Added device Idle prior to shutdown to play nice across host power cycles
  2) Fixed flags used to determine valid time for GNSS time message
* Fixed time reference output to use ROS time for header timestamp
* sensor_msgs::TimeReference added per user request
* Added a resume command at the end of device setup as the GQ7 needs it.
* 1) Changed GQ7 filter init alignment selector to a bitfield in the example launch file
  2) Fixed quaternion sensor2vehicle frame rotation (negated the indices instead of the values by accident)
* See changelog for full details.
